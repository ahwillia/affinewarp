# Piecewise Linear Time Warping

This repo contains research code for time warping multi-dimensional time series. This was developed as part of the following manuscript, which focuses on analysis of large-scale neural recordings (though this code can be also be applied to many other data types):

The code fits time warping models with either linear or piecewise linear warping functions. These models are more constrained than the classic [Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_time_warping) algorithm, and are thus less prone to overfit to data with high levels of noise. This is demonstrated below on synthethic data. Briefly, a 1-dimensional time series is measured over many repetitions (trials), and exhibits a similar temporal profile but with random jitter on each trial. Simply averaging across trials produces a poor description of the typical time series (red trace at bottom). A linear time warping model identifies a much better prototypical trace (labeled "template"), while accounting for the temporal translations on each trial with warping functions (blue to red linear functions at bottom). On the right, a nonlinear warping model based on DTW (called [DBA](https://github.com/fpetitjean/DBA)) is shown for comparison. While DBA can work well on datasets with low noise, linear warping models can be easier to interpret and less likely to overfit.

## Getting started

After installing (see [below](#installing)), check out the demos in the [`examples/`](https://github.com/ahwillia/affinewarp/tree/master/examples) folder.

* `Shift.ipynb` - demonstrates the essential ideas on a very simple, synthethic dataset containing only one neuron.
* `OFC-2.ipynb` - shows a more complete analysis on real data. The tutorial uses a publicly available dataset from [crcns.org](https://crcns.org/), which can be found [here](https://crcns.org/data-sets/ofc/ofc-2/about-ofc-2). See `OFC-2-wrangle-data.ipynb` for instructions on downloading and organizing the dataset.

The code is fairly well-documented but the tutorials can still be improved, so let us know if you run into trouble. 

## Installing

This package isn't registered yet, so you need to install manually. Either download or clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/ahwillia/affinewarp/
```

Then navigate to the downloaded folder:

```
cd /path/to/affinewarp
```

Install the package and requirements:

```
pip install .
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You will need to repeat these steps if we update the code.

* [tw-pca](https://github.com/ganguli-lab/twpca) - Time-Warping Principal Components Analysis, also supports linear and shift-only warping functions. Does not support piecewise linear warping functions and assumes that time series are low-dimensional. Nonlinear warping methods are also supported. See our [conference abstract](https://cs.stanford.edu/~poole/twpca_poster.pdf) and [poster](https://cs.stanford.edu/~poole/twpca_poster.pdf).
